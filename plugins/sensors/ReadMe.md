In the previous example, when using the GitHub API to fetch commits, the `sha` parameter is used to specify the branch from which the commits should be retrieved. This is important because it allows us to target a specific branch rather than just the default branch of the repository. Hereâ€™s why specifying the branch with `sha` is significant:

### Why Use `sha` to Specify the Branch?

1. **Targeting a Specific Branch**:
   - By providing the branch name as the `sha` parameter, we ensure that we're only looking at commits from that specific branch.
   - This is crucial in repositories with multiple branches where each branch may have its own history and changes.

2. **Branch-Specific Changes**:
   - Different branches often represent different stages of development (e.g., `main`, `develop`, `feature-xyz`).
   - A file might be modified in one branch but not in another, so specifying the branch allows for branch-specific monitoring.

3. **Precise Commit Retrieval**:
   - The `sha` parameter effectively acts as a reference point for the branch's commit history.
   - This ensures the sensor retrieves the correct commit list associated with the specified branch, allowing you to assess only the relevant changes.

4. **Avoiding Misleading Results**:
   - Without specifying the branch, you might get results from the default branch or other branches where the file hasn't changed.
   - This can lead to false negatives or positives if your automation or alerts depend on precise file change detection.

5. **Handling Multiple Branches in Workflows**:
   - If your CI/CD pipeline or data workflow has branch-specific logic, monitoring changes on a particular branch is essential.
   - This is particularly useful in workflows where different branches trigger different actions.

6. **Branch Context**:
   - Using the `sha` helps maintain the context of the branch being monitored. In many workflows, understanding changes in the context of a specific branch is critical for decision-making.

### How It Works

Here's a deeper dive into how the `sha` parameter is used in the example to ensure you're querying the right commits:

#### Code Example:

```python
commits = repo.get_commits(since=since_time, sha=self.branch)
```

- **`repo.get_commits`**: This method fetches the commits from a repository.
- **`since=since_time`**: This parameter filters the commits to those made after a specific time (e.g., 24 hours ago).
- **`sha=self.branch`**: This parameter specifies the branch from which the commits should be fetched.

### Example Scenario

Imagine you have a repository with the following branches:

- `main`: Production-ready code.
- `develop`: Staging and integration.
- `feature/new-ui`: A feature branch under active development.

You want to monitor changes to `config/settings.py` only in the `feature/new-ui` branch to ensure that changes are tracked and don't conflict with ongoing development in other branches. Using the `sha` parameter allows you to specifically monitor the `feature/new-ui` branch without interference from changes in `main` or `develop`.

### Full Example: `GitHubFileChangedSensor` with Branch-Specific Logic

Below is the full implementation of `GitHubFileChangedSensor` that uses the `sha` parameter for branch-specific monitoring:

```python
# plugins/sensors/custom_github_sensors.py

from airflow.providers.github.sensors.github import GitHubSensor
from airflow.utils.decorators import apply_defaults
from github import Github
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

class GitHubFileChangedSensor(GitHubSensor):
    
    @apply_defaults
    def __init__(self, owner, repo, branch, file_path, github_conn_id='github_default', *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(github_conn_id=github_conn_id, *args, **kwargs)
        self.owner = owner
        self.repo = repo
        self.branch = branch
        self.file_path = file_path

    def poke(self, context):
        self.log.info(f"Checking for changes in '{self.file_path}' on branch '{self.branch}' of repo '{self.repo}'.")

        # Get the GitHub connection
        hook = self.get_hook()
        github = hook.get_conn()
        repo = github.get_repo(f"{self.owner}/{self.repo}")

        # Determine the time 24 hours ago
        since_time = datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(hours=24)

        # Retrieve commits from the specific branch within the last 24 hours
        commits = repo.get_commits(since=since_time, sha=self.branch)
        self.log.info(f"Found {commits.totalCount} commits in the last 24 hours on branch '{self.branch}'.")

        # Check if the specified file was changed in any of the commits
        for commit in commits:
            self.log.info(f"Checking commit '{commit.sha}'.")
            commit_details = repo.get_commit(commit.sha)
            for file in commit_details.files:
                if file.filename == self.file_path:
                    self.log.info(f"File '{self.file_path}' was changed in commit '{commit.sha}'.")
                    return True

        self.log.info(f"No changes detected in file '{self.file_path}' in the last 24 hours on branch '{self.branch}'.")
        return False
```

### Key Points:

- **Branch-Specific Retrieval**: Commits are retrieved only from the specified branch, avoiding any interference from other branches.
- **Accurate File Change Detection**: Ensures that file changes are correctly detected within the context of the specified branch.
- **Detailed Logging**: Provides logging to track which commits are checked, which helps in debugging and understanding the workflow.

### Conclusion

Using the `sha` parameter to specify the branch is a crucial aspect of precise monitoring in multi-branch repositories. It helps maintain context, ensures accurate change detection, and supports workflows that are dependent on branch-specific logic. This approach is essential for scenarios where different branches have different roles, responsibilities, and change histories.
